{"name":"JImageViewer","tagline":"A Java application designed to easily view, manipulate, and organize images","body":"JImageViewer is a simple Java application designed to easily view, manipulate, and organize images. It was created with performance and easy of use in mind, so important functionality is displayed front and center and the entire interface is carefully crafted to be extremely intuitive. JImageViewer utilizes native technologies for all of its core functionality, but uses specialized functions to efficiently perform repetitive image tasks.\r\n\r\nAlthough JImageViewer is very straightforward, it includes several useful features that allow the user to continue with their routine image-related activities. These include dynamic album creation, multiple views, basic search, and a variety of quick editing tools. In addition, JImageViewer is optimized for the latest hardware and integrated deeply with the user's operating system. The application fully supports Retina/HiDPI screens, multitouch displays and trackpads, and uses the default desktop theme and widget style.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nJImageViewer offers tons of exciting and practical features:\r\n* Simple, easy to use interface\r\n* Two distinct viewing modes\r\n* Multithreaded image loading\r\n* Multitouch and HiDPI/Retina optimization\r\n* Support for multiple image directories\r\n* Compatibility with native photo management technologies\r\n* Operating system theme integration\r\n* Dynamic photo album creation\r\n* Information about images and albums\r\n* Basic editing capabilities\r\n* Customizable slideshow mode\r\n* Wikipedia metadata integration\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe files provided here are the only the source files for JImageViewer. To run the application, you can compile them yourself or create an executable JAR package by following the steps below:\r\n\r\n1. In a terminal, enter the directory of the JImageViewer source files and run `javac JImageViewer.java`. If you just want to run the application for testing purposes, use the command `java JImageViewer` and stop after that. Continue if you want to use JImageViewer as a full-fledged app on your system.\r\n2. Run `jar cvfe JImageViewer.jar JImageViewer *.class`. The output that follows is normal.\r\n3. Launch JImageViewer with `java -jar JImageViewer.jar` or mark the file as executable and double-click on it.\r\n\r\nThat's it! By default, JImageViewer reads your normal Pictures directory, but you can set a new location in the preferences dialog.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nIt's really easy to begin using JImageViewer. When you first launch the application, you'll be presented with an elegant welcome screen that prompts you to choose an image folder. If you choose, you can disable the welcome screen in the preferences dialog.\r\n\r\nOnce you select a directory, you'll be taken to the main image pane containing all of your images. As you scroll through the thumbnails, new pictures will appear near the bottom of the pane. Click on an image to see more details. The image will expand and an info pane on the right will show important facts about the image. Edits can be made using the buttons near the top-right of the toolbar.\r\n\r\nThere's much more to discover when using JImageViewer, but those are the basics. If there's something you'd like to change, simply open the preferences dialog by going to Edit > Preferences in the menu.\r\n\r\n### More Information\r\n\r\nJImageViewer is still in active development, so new features are on the way and some aspects of JImageViewer are not complete. Feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/fishdev/JImageViewer/pulls) to JImageViewer right here on GitHub or try it out and submit new [issues](https://github.com/fishdev/JImageViewer/issues) for features you'd like to see in the application.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how to install, use, and contribute to JImageViewer, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/fishdev/JImageViewer/wiki).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
